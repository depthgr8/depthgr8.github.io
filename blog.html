                Today, while scrolling through LinkedIn, something caught my attention. An ex-colleague of mine had shared a thoughtful commentary on a newspaper article. His reflections insightful and interesting.
                But as I read further, I noticed something missing. The original source (The newspaper article) hadn’t been credited. In my humble opinion, this felt like an important gap. After all, when we build our thoughts on someone else’s work, isn’t it our responsibility to acknowledge where it came from?
                </p><p>
                For a few minutes, I debated with myself. Should I write a comment? Would it come across as offensive? Or would it spark a meaningful conversation? Finally, I chose the balanced path, I wrote something polite and reflective, framing it as my curiosity rather than criticism.
                That moment gave me a realization: many of us, even professionals, sometimes overlook intellectual property rights (IPR). Not because we intend to do harm, but simply because we don’t think about it in the flow of sharing.
                And that’s when an idea clicked. What if I could use my own platform to spread awareness about this? Not through heavy lectures, but in simple and engaging ways that make us pause and reflect.
                </p><p>
                So, I’ve decided to start a short lecture series on my YouTube channel — small videos where I’ll talk about everyday situations like this and what they teach us about research ethics and respecting IPR. My hope is that these stories will remind us of our duties: to build knowledge responsibly, and to ensure we never harm someone else’s intellectual contributions.
                If this resonates with you, I invite you to join me on this journey. Sometimes, the smallest observations can lead to the most meaningful conversations.

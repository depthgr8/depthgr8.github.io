                Today, while scrolling through LinkedIn, something caught my attention. An ex-colleague of mine had shared a thoughtful commentary on a newspaper article. His reflections insightful and interesting.
                But as I read further, I noticed something missing. The original source (The newspaper article) hadn’t been credited. In my humble opinion, this felt like an important gap. After all, when we build our thoughts on someone else’s work, isn’t it our responsibility to acknowledge where it came from?
                </p><p>
                For a few minutes, I debated with myself. Should I write a comment? Would it come across as offensive? Or would it spark a meaningful conversation? Finally, I chose the balanced path, I wrote something polite and reflective, framing it as my curiosity rather than criticism.
                That moment gave me a realization: many of us, even professionals, sometimes overlook intellectual property rights (IPR). Not because we intend to do harm, but simply because we don’t think about it in the flow of sharing.
                And that’s when an idea clicked. What if I could use my own platform to spread awareness about this? Not through heavy lectures, but in simple and engaging ways that make us pause and reflect.
                </p><p>
                So, I’ve decided to start a short lecture series on my YouTube channel — small videos where I’ll talk about everyday situations like this and what they teach us about research ethics and respecting IPR. My hope is that these stories will remind us of our duties: to build knowledge responsibly, and to ensure we never harm someone else’s intellectual contributions.
                If this resonates with you, I invite you to join me on this journey. Sometimes, the smallest observations can lead to the most meaningful conversations.

                <p>The principle of abstraction in programming is to hide complicated details and only show what is necessary for understanding and using. This idea is interesting because it goes far beyond code. The world works through layers of meaning and structure that aren't obvious. There are scientific formulas, physical laws, encrypted data, and biological patterns hidden beneath the surface of everyday things. All of these things are waiting to be discovered through observation, logic, and creativity. These hidden layers give everything we experience more depth and meaning, just like abstraction in software.
                </p>
                <p>
                People have come up with different ways to hide and show information over the years. Acrostics are a mix of language and puzzle-like design that hide messages in the first letters of words or lines. Cryptography changes information into coded forms to keep secrets safe or prove that something is real. Steganography takes things a step further by hiding communication in plain sight by putting data inside other media, like images or sounds. The Enigma machine, which was used during World War II, is a great example of how smart people can hide and decode important information during wartime.
                </p>
                <p>
                Learning about these tools and methods helps us understand how abstraction works in both technology and everyday life. Learning how to read symbols, patterns, and codes not only helps you solve problems, but it also helps you understand better how knowledge is kept, protected, and shared. Whether they are digital or conceptual, cracking these codes is a journey of discovery that turns hidden complexity into useful information.
